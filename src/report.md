** Sasa, in February 2024, OpenAI launched Swarm, a collaborative AI system inspired by biological swarms. Swarm comprises multiple AI agents that communicate, cooperate, and learn from each other, tackling complex tasks more effectively than individual models. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning, each agent improves its behavior while interacting with others and the environment. OpenAI demonstrated Swarm's prowess in resource management, navigation, and problem-solving, outperforming single models and other multi-agent systems. Designed to scale, Swarm's flexibility allows it to handle diverse problems. Released open-source, Swarm invites community exploration and improvement. Experts anticipate it revolutionizing industries like robotics and logistics. OpenAI plans further developments, incorporating AI advancements and exploring new applications. Sawa!
